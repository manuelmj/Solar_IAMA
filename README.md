## ***Web Scraping***

in this section of the project, the _Scrapy framework_ was used to perform a scraping of the [_Enfsolar_](https://es.enfsolar.com) website to download information about the photovoltaic panels available in Colombia, in order to  perform a research work with data collection.
The result was more than 1500 data in an excel file with _STC_, _NOCT_ and _THERMAL CHARACTERISTICS_ information corresponding to the solar panel.
the code and the explanation can be seen in the following link [**_web scraping_**](https://github.com/manuelmj/Solar_IAMA/tree/main/ENF_scraper)
